<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>I'm a full stack developer from Mukilteo, WA.</p>

<p>After earning my BA (Financial Economics, Philosophy - WWU '11) I ended up working in accounting. Only problem is, I hate accounting!</p>

<p>So I decided a change was in order. I attended the Coding Dojo bootcamp and am eager to apply my new found skills.</p>
